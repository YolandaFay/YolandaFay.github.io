I am doing a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù thing. I enrolled in a year-long full stack development boot camp‚Ä¶while working full-time‚Ä¶on a whim.

Well, not really on a whim. Let‚Äôs back up a bit‚Ä¶when I finished my undergraduate degrees in 2012, I took a year off to teach and figure out what was next. I was at a crossroads between pursing the left side of my brain (B.S. Math/CS) in software engineering or the right side of my brain (B.A. English/Spanish) in literature. I ultimately settled on the path less traveled down the middle and completed an M.A. in History of Mathematics and Science Studies. Then I got a job in commercial real estate. Logical transition, right? There‚Äôs a whole bunch of fun stuff in the middle there, but, for the purposes of this blog and my current goals, the only relevant thing is that I am now sort of back at the crossroads and giving it another go.

I stumbled upon the Flatiron school somewhat serendipitously after attending Meetup‚Äôs Togetherfest in New York and seeing an ad for the Women Take Tech scholarship they were sponsoring. I‚Äôd been trying to find a new career move for a while and was riding high on inspiration that weekend, so I applied and won! And here I am üôÇ
