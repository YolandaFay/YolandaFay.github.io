I've been avoiding this blog post because I genuinely don't understand the prompt in relation to transitioning back to Ruby. I also realize we don't *have* to follow the prompts so maybe I should have just written something else? It was a brief Git/Github & HMTL/CSS blurb detour followed by a series of redundant intro lessons in Ruby (which I've also been delaying due to an unexpected home makeover made complete by half my house being torn out and a thin layer of construction dust covering everything I own - thanks!). I'm not sure if I missed something, but I'm not seeing the core of what I should be pondering. Perhaps other random thoughts will suffice as I aspire to remain a relevant student.

The Git/Github section was new and interesting to me. I'm looking forward to working with git more once I've moved beyond the IDE in browser. I'm currently on my company's laptop (i.e. 8-5 corporate cogwheel gig) so I'm limited on installs/environment and everything is made easy for me with the nice "fork this lab" button. Hoping to have my own machine soon to transition and get a less hand-held sense of the raw programming environment. 

With that said, I must say that I am here because I'm seeking to move beyond my current job and want to be doing anything else, yet it is what continues to impede my Flatiron progress. Sure, that's a lame excuse because as every successful athlete would say "If ya want something bad enough...." blah blah - yeah, you don't make lame excuses. But it sucks and has been a rough start, and I'm hoping to gain more momentum over the next month. Last thing I want is to finish this curriculum and still be in the same position I was hoping to get out of...which would be a travesty. 

So here goes nothing - carry on!
