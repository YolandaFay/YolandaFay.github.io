I've been avoiding this blog post because I genuinely don't understand the prompt in relation to transitioning back to Ruby. It was a brief Git/Github & HMTL/CSS blurb detour followed by a series of redundant intro lessons in Ruby (which I've also been avoiding due to an unexpected home makeover made complete by half my house being torn out and a thin layer of construction dust covering everything I own - thanks!). I'm not sure if I missed something or if my curriculum got mixed up, but I'm not seeing the core of what I should be pondering. Perhaps other random thoughts will suffice as I aspire to remain a relevant student.

All I can surmise is that my prior knowledge of HTML/CSS and coding in general is streamlining the curriculum in a way such that I'm missing some of the noob reflection points. Regardless, the Git/Github section was new and interesting to me. I'm looking forward to working with git more once I've moved beyond the IDE in browser. I'm currently on my company's laptop (i.e. 8-5 corporate CRE gig *barf*) so I'm limited on installs/environment and everything is made easy for me with the nice "fork this lab" button. Hoping to have my own machine soon to transition and get a less hand-held sense of the raw programming environment. 

With that said, I must say that I am here because I hate my current job and want to be doing anything else yet my current job continues to impede my Flatiron progress. Sure, that's a lame excuse because as every successful athlete would say "If ya want something bad enough...." blah blah - yeah, you don't make lame excuses. But it sucks and has been a rough start, and I'm hoping to gain more momentum over the next month. Last thing I want is to finish this curriculum and still be in the crappy position I was hoping to get out of...which would be a travesty. 

So here goes nothing - carry on!
