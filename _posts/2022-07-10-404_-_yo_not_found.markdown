Alright, it's time to be real. I can't believe it's been 4 years since I enrolled in this program, and I couldn't finish it. Another case of Self-Paced program failure. This is actually really shocking to me in many ways because I was a stellar student. I genuinely didn't think I'd be one to flop out. Worst part is, I paid the whole loan. 

But I learned a lot along the way - life is wild. It changes without giving you a heads up, and I'm miles from where I was when I thought this was a reality. I also know now that I needed to know myself better...too many carrots, not enough sticks. I always did well in school because I had concrete motivations and set goals. I *needed* to succeed. 

It's harder when I'm working full-time and not willing to sacrifice all my free time to move ahead. I also didn't want to take the risk of quitting my job, but it's really what I should have done. Go in 100%. 

Anyway, I felt like I wanted to write this because 1. it wraps up my awkward blog and 2. it feels good to acknowledge that I failed, and that's ok. 

Onwards!
